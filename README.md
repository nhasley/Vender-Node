## App Must:
☐ Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the "User" Model. One entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a 1:M or M:M relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced).

☐ Use OAuth authentication. (lesson this week)

☐ Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.

☐ Have complete CRUD data operations between all data entities. For example, you can have functionality that Creates & Updates a post (data entity) and satisfy Delete functionality by implementing the ability to delete comments (data entity).

☐ Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and neat presentation.

☐ Be deployed online (Heroku).

Optionally, Your App May:
☐ Consume a third-party API.

☐ Expose its own API where it returns data resources as JSON.

## Necessary Deliverables
☐ A working full-stack app that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on Heroku.

A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style landing page" instead of "Styled landing page".
