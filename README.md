## App Must:
X Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the "User" Model. One entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a 1:M or M:M relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced).

X Use OAuth authentication. (lesson this week)

☐ Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.

☐ Have complete CRUD data operations between all data entities. For example, you can have functionality that Creates & Updates a post (data entity) and satisfy Delete functionality by implementing the ability to delete comments (data entity).

X Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and neat presentation.

X Be deployed online (Heroku).

Optionally, Your App May:
☐ Consume a third-party API.

X Expose its own API where it returns data resources as JSON.

## Necessary Deliverables
☐ A working full-stack app that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on Heroku.

A README.md file with these sections:

# Vender
